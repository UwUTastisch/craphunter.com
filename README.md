## install backend (Pocketbase)

(While development i am using pocketbase [v0.23.12](https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/tag/v0.23.12), but newer version should work as well)
https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases


```bash
cd backend
curl -i https://github.com/pocketbase/pocketbase/releases/download/v0.23.12/pocketbase_0.23.12_linux_amd64.zip
unzip pocketbase_0.24.1_linux_amd64.zip
